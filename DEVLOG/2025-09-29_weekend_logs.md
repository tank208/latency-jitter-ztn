## Network Performance Analysis Summary

### **Key Findings:**

**Ping Performance (Excellent):**

- **Average latency**: 0.22 ms - extremely low, indicating excellent local network performance
- **Latency range**: 0.14 - 0.60 ms - very consistent
- **No packet loss detected** in the data
- All 8 ping tests between pi1 and pi2 show sub-millisecond latency

**Jitter (Excellent):**

- **Average jitter**: 0.008 ms - negligible jitter
- Maximum jitter observed was only 0.01 ms in iperf tests
- This indicates very stable network conditions with minimal variation

**Bandwidth (Area of Concern):**

- **Average bandwidth**: 917 kbps (~0.9 Mbps)
- This is quite low for modern networks
- One test showed only 750 kbps bandwidth

**Errors:**

- No explicit errors found in the summary data
- No packet loss indicators present
- Network appears stable but bandwidth-constrained

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Investigate Bandwidth Limitation** (Priority: High)
    - 917 kbps is unusually low - is this intentional (rate limiting) or a bottleneck?
    - Check if Raspberry Pi network interfaces are configured for 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps
    - Verify cable quality (Cat5e/Cat6) and switch port speeds
    - Run additional iperf tests with different parameters (TCP window size, parallel streams)
2. **Extended Testing** (Priority: Medium)
    - Conduct longer duration tests (24+ hours) to capture any time-based patterns
    - Test during different times of day to identify if there are load-related issues
    - Add bidirectional testing (pi2 to pi1) to check for asymmetric issues
3. **Add Monitoring** (Priority: Medium)
    - Implement packet loss monitoring (current data doesn't show this metric)
    - Add CPU/memory utilization tracking during tests
    - Monitor for network interface errors and drops
4. **Baseline Documentation** (Priority: Low)
    - Current performance appears consistent - document these values as baseline
    - Network latency is excellent for local communication
    - Use these metrics for comparison after any network changes

**Overall Assessment**: Network latency and jitter are excellent, but bandwidth is significantly constrained. The network is stable but may not support high-throughput applications.
