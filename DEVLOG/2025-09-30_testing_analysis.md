# Ping and iPerf3 test 20250926 to 20250928
### Key findings
1. Ping performance
	1. Average latency: 0.22 ms - extremely low
	2. Latency range: 0.14-0.60 ms - consistent
	3. No packet loss
	4. Sub millisecond latency
2. Jitter
	1. Average jitter: 0.008 ms
	2. Maximum jitter: 0.01 ms
	3. Stable network
3. Bandwidth
	1. Average bandwidth: 917 kbps - low
	2. Lowest record: 750 kbps - anomoly?
4. Errors
	1. No explicit errors found
	2. No packet loss
	3. Network test-bed stable

### Next Steps
1. Investigate Bandwidth Limitation
	1. Verify Pi network interface is configured to > 100 Mbps
	2. Verify cable quality
	3. Run additional iperf tests
2. Extended testing
	1. Conduct longer duration tests to capture time based patterns
	2. Add bi-directional testing (pi to pi) for asymmetric issues
3. Add monitoring
	1. Implement packet loss monitoring
	2. Add CPU/Memory utilization tracking during tests
	3. Monitor for network interface errors and drops
4. Baseline documentation
	1. Current performance appears consistent
	2. Network latency is excellent for local communication
