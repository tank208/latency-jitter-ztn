# Latency & Jitter in Zero Trust Networks

**Student:** Will Hall  
**Faculty:** Dr. John Shovic, Dr. Mary Everett  
**Project Type:** FAFSA Work Study Research (transitioning to EPAF-funded Research)  
**Institution:** University of Idaho â€“ Coeur dâ€™Alene, Center for Intelligent Industrial Robotics (CIIR)
---

## Overview
The project measures latency and jitter in Zero-Trust environments and evaluates Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and Network Time Protocol (NTP) performance in industrial control system (ICS) and operational technology (OT) contexts.

The project began with baseline **latency and jitter** analysis across isolated and Zero-Trust networks (NILE platform) and is now expanding into **secure, low-cost time synchronization** for electrical and industrial systems under the Energy Institute.

## Project Phases

| Phase | Title | Description | Status |
|:------|:-------|:-------------|:--------|
| **01** | [Raspberry Pi Time Sync](./01_RPI_time_sync) | Establishes LAN latency and jitter baselines under NILE Zero Trust configurations. Uses Raspberry Pi 4B nodes, Chrony, and iperf3 for precise measurement. | Baseline complete |
| **02** | [Infrastructure Timing Pivot](./02_infrastructure_timing) | Builds on Phase 1 results by integrating micro-PLCs (Arduino Opta) for cyber-physical synchronization studies. Focus: PTP, GPS-independent timing, and secure overlays (Tailscale, WireGuard). | In development |
| **DEVLOG** | [Research Logbook](./DEVLOG) | Daily/weekly development notes, test results, and progress summaries for both phases. | Ongoing |

## Methodology

1. **Baseline (Phase 1):** Measure network jitter across air-gapped and NILE Zero Trust configurations.  
2. **Infrastructure Integration (Phase 2):** Couple network data with physical control timing.  
3. **Secure Overlay:** Test how encryption layers affect precision.
4. **Compare NTP vs PTP** performance under identical network conditions to quantify trade-offs in accuracy and resource load.
5. **Resilient PNT Analysis:** Explore GPS-denied synchronization and trustworthiness of timing sources.  
6. **Reporting:** Document, visualize, and publish results for academic and industry audiences.

## Current Status
- Baseline data collection complete.  
- Pivot phase mapping (Energy Institute collaboration).  
- Integration and PTP testing scheduled.
