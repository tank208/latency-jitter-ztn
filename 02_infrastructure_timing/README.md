# Phase II â€“ Infrastructure Timing Pivot (Energy Institute Collaboration)

**Objective:**  
Extend the RPi/NILE baseline to explore secure, low-cost time synchronization between electrical infrastructure nodes and Zero-Trust overlays.

**Scope:**  
- Integrate Arduino Opta (micro PLC) with existing RPi nodes.  
- Test PTP vs. Chrony synchronization precision.  
- Evaluate GPS-independent resilience and timing security.  
- Collaborate with Energy Institute for practical infrastructure applications.
